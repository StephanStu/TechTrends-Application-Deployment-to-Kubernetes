# TechTrends-Application Deployment to a Kubernetes Cluster
This is my solution to project 1 of the Cloud Native Application Architecture Nanodegree Program. The goal is to enhance an application with endpoints for health & metrics and deploy it using a container orchestration tool, k3s, and open-source continuous integration & continuous deployment solutions (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD).
